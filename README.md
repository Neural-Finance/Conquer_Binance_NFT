# Conquer_Binance_NFT

### Motivation
I have gone around Opensea, Dappradar, ETH Chain to see their NFT (Non-Fungible Token) price and volume data. Unfortunately, all of them has very strict anti-websrcaper policy. Basically, I tried to pretend myself as a web browser, also trying to fill in the requested payload data, or trying to find some tricks/rules among the url links. None of them worked. Maybe they count on selling data to make money. You can chose to buy data API access from Opensea and DappRadar. 

Or you can choose to use selenium to deal with it, to the best of my knowledge, selenium + advanced knowledge of anti-captcha, can solve any webscrapying problem, but it just very very stupid and not elegent.

Here I give a modern method to deal with **Binance NFT data** (https://www.binance.com/zh-CN/nft/ranking?tab=collection&chain=ETH), if some one, have the need to deal with ETH chain or Opensea, and would like treat me several couple of coffee, I would consider spending more time.
